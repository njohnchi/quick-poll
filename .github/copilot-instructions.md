* When debugging a TypeScript error first run `npx nuxi prepare` to ensure all of Nuxt's autogenerated types are available.

* The dev server is probably already up and running on localhost:3000. If not, run `nr dev` to start it.

* Read and use the following cursor rules when needed based on description. It's VERY IMPORTANT that you think about if you need any of these and include them when related to the task at hand:
    * [api.instructions.md](md:./instructions/api.instructions.md) - rules for working with API endpoitns
    * [testing.instructions.md](md:./instructions/testing.instructions.md) - rules for writing unit and e2e tests
    * [database.instructions.md](md:./instructions/database.instructions.md) - rules for interacting with the database
    * [components.instructions.md](md:./instructions/components.instructions.md) - rules for working with components
    * [pages.instructions.md](md:./instructions/pages.instructions.md) - rules for working with pages
    * * [common-errors.instructions.mdc](md:.cursor/rules/common-errors.instructions.md) - rules for responding to common errors


## State Management

* Only use state management external to components when necessary
* Utilize caching with useFetch and useAsync data for as much state management for fetched data as possible otherwise use a custom composable and useState

## Workflow rules

* At the end of each chat session, think about what you've done and what is left to do to meet the user's request or recommend next steps.
