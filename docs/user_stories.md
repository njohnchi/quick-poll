# üìë Project Requirements Document Table

| Feature ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------|
| FR001 | Create a poll with a question and multiple options | As a poll creator, I want to create a poll with a question and multiple options so that I can gather opinions from others. | The system should allow the creator to enter a question, add at least two options, and save the poll. Invalid inputs (e.g., empty question or fewer than two options) should trigger an error message. |
| FR002 | Generate a shareable link or QR code | As a poll creator, I want to generate a shareable link or QR code so that I can easily distribute my poll to participants. | The system should generate a unique URL and QR code after poll creation. Anyone with the link/QR code should be able to access the poll. |
| FR003 | Preview a poll before publishing | As a poll creator, I want to preview my poll before publishing it so that I can ensure it looks correct. | The system should provide a preview screen showing the poll as it will appear to participants. The creator can go back and edit before finalizing. |
| FR004 | Vote without account creation | As a participant, I want to vote quickly without creating an account so that I can engage with the poll easily. | The system should allow participants to select an option and submit it without requiring registration. Invalid submissions (e.g., empty selection) should show an error message. |
| FR005 | Confirm vote submission | As a participant, I want to receive confirmation that my vote has been recorded so that I know my input was counted. | After submitting a vote, the system should display a confirmation message (e.g., ‚ÄúYour vote has been recorded‚Äù). Attempts to re-vote should be blocked with a message stating only one vote is allowed. |
| FR006 | Ensure anonymous voting | As a participant, I want my vote to remain anonymous so that I feel safe sharing my opinion. | The system should not display or store personally identifiable information alongside the vote. Only aggregated results should be shown. |
| FR007 | Real-time results display | As a participant, I want to see real-time results after voting so that I can understand the overall opinion immediately. | After voting, participants should see live updates of poll results as percentages and counts. If the creator has disabled results, a message should indicate results are hidden until the poll closes. |
| FR008 | Close a poll | As a poll creator, I want to close or end the poll when I decide so that no further votes are collected. | The system should allow the creator to manually close a poll. Once closed, participants attempting to vote should see a message that the poll is no longer accepting votes. |
